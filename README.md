# Yaamini's FISH 546 Repository

For my project, I will analyze four different Olympic oyster (*Ostrea lurida*) gonad transcriptomes. These transcriptomes are from male and female specimens, exposed to either control or ocean acidification conditions.

My goal is to **understand how ocean acidification conditions affect DNA methylation and protein expression in *O. lurida* gonads**.

### Objectives

1. Identify differences in DNA methylation and protein expressions between samples exposed to control and ocean acidification conditions
2. Determine if responses to stress conditions vary in male and female specimens
3. Understand basic bioninformatic analysis techniques (FastQC, MultiQC, BLAST, etc.)
4. Create reproducible protocols for anlaysis
5. Produce a written report of findings

### Project Timeline

**Week 4**: 
- Run BLAST against specialized transcriptome
- Analyze data files for differential transcription

**Week 5**:
- Start statistical analyses for differential transcription
- Start to identify differences in DNA methylation
