    "In the DESeq Tutorial, I learn how to use `DESeq2` in R to find differentially expressed genes. The first part of the tutorial can be viewed [here](https://github.com/yaaminiv/yaaminiv-fish546-2016/blob/master/tutorials/2016-10-26-DESeq2-Tutorial.R). In this part of the tutorial, I will use the `Phel_DEGlist.tab` file as a database to find a gene in the *Ostrea lurida* (Olympia oyster) taxa that is similar to a gene differentially expressed in sea stars that exhibit wasting disease. To do this, I will use BLAST (click here to see a previously completed BLAST tutorial: [part 1](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Documents/School/Year1/FISH-546/yaaminiv-fish546-2016/tutorials/2016-10-11-Blast-Tutorial-Part-1.ipynb) and [part 2](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Documents/School/Year1/FISH-546/yaaminiv-fish546-2016/tutorials/2016-10-11-Blast-Tutorial-Part-2.ipynb))."
